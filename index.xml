      <description>Iâ€™m a scalable, highly available and reliable engineer who is transitioning from the oilfield to the cloud. I strongly believe in education and hands-on experience to shape up a well-rounded engineer, which shall result in a valuable asset to any future employer.
I graduated from the George Washington University with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering (yes, the wheel was invented by a mechanical engineer).
Making a career shift is never a simple task.</description>

      <description>I find self-learning is the most significant and effective skill among all skills someone can acquire; however, there is a need for the proper tools to acquire the self-learning skill. Here comes in tutorial to fill the gap which is a VERY important teaching/learning tool. It helps people learn new skills by using a step by step process, which ensures the optimal comprehension of the materials or the subject.
As an engineer, I have, fortunately, acquired self-learning skill during my engineering school.</description>
