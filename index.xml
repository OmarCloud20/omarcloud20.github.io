      <description>Iâ€™m a scalable, highly available and reliable engineer. I strongly believe in education and hands-on experience to shape up a well-rounded engineer, which shall result in a valuable asset to any future employer.
I graduated from the George Washington University with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering (yes, the wheel was invented by a mechanical engineerðŸ˜‰). I earned my International MBA from Texas Tech University and started working towards my Post Graduate Certificate in Cloud Computing from the University of Texas Austin.</description>

      <description>I find self-learning is the most vital, significant and effective skill among all skills someone can acquire; however, without the proper tools, self-learning skill tends to be difficult to acquire. Utilizing the publicly available tutorials/workshops to fill the knowledge gap is a VERY important learning tool. These tutorials do tremendously help people learn new skills in our new era of online learning. Using a step by step process ensures the optimal comprehension of the materials or the subject in scope.</description>
